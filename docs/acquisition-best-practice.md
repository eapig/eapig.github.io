title: Best Practices for Acquiring Email Archives
permalink: /acquisition-best-practice/

> The present version of this page has been put together from the group's working notes (Google doc) to demonstrate how a finished product might look. This necessarily includes one contributor's edits and phrasing interpreting the group's work, none of which should be considered final!

This document is designed to help identify the considerations involved in aquisition of email archives specifically which do not appear in, or are significantly different compared to, acquisition of other electronic archives. This assumes that the repository has identified email as a type of digital resource of interest. Clear, high-level leadership is necessary to build up the skills and resources to successfully build and run an email collecting effort

## Initial groundwork

### What processes do you want to be able to achieve?

- Collecting emails from donors/creators
  - High variance between institutional and external source, and also depending on technical knowledge/resources of donor
  - Need to establish collection method. Options include:
    - IMAP transfer
	- Google Takeout (for Gmail accounts)
	- Transfer of files downloaded from clients, eg MBOX; same requirements as reliable transfer of any other files from donors
	- Need to ensure sufficient storage available; email accounts covering several years with frequent use of attachments can easily take up multiple Terrabytes, and size may not be immediately apparant if not using a simple file download and transfer.
- Converting emails between formats
  - Various software solutions exist; there is no one size fits all
  - Choice often depends on required input / output formats. Some tools are designed to chain better into specific further steps
- Appraising email collections
  - https://ratom.web.unc.edu/
- Redacting information within emails
  - https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd
- Providing access to email collections
  - What data do you want to make available?
  - How will you mediate access?
  - Public portal vs dedicated terminal(s) at repository

> What in this access point is email-specific?
  
### Internal policies required

- Types of email you will collect
  - Limit to certain formats?
  - Refuse encrypted material?
- How to deal with 3rd party information found in email collections
- Embargo periods
  - May be necessary if your institution doesn't have robust redaction capability
  - Can be blanket, or case-by-case
  
### Assembling your team

There will be wide variance here depending on the size of your organisation. This section could be used by a lone archivist to identify which tasks they should be considering and can cover with their current skills; or by a large organisation to work out which departments need to be included. Some of these things may be able to be covered by external contractors, vendors, professional groups, etc.

> Need to work out how to ensure this section doesn't just repeat / overlap with the Processes section above
