title: Best Practices for Acquiring Email Archives
permalink: /acquisition-best-practice/
---
> The present version of this page has been put together from the group's working notes (Google doc) to demonstrate how a finished product might look. This is just one contributor's edits and phrasing interpreting the group's work, none of which should be considered final!

This document is designed to help identify the considerations involved in aquisition of email archives specifically which do not appear in, or are significantly different compared to, acquisition of other electronic archives. This assumes that the repository has identified email as a type of digital resource of interest. Clear, high-level leadership is necessary to build up the skills and resources to successfully build and run an email collecting effort

## Initial groundwork

### What processes do you want to be able to achieve?

- Collecting emails from donors/creators
  - High variance between institutional and external source, and also depending on technical knowledge/resources of donor
  - Need to establish collection method. Options include:
    - IMAP transfer
	- Google Takeout (for Gmail accounts)
	- Transfer of files downloaded from clients, eg MBOX; same requirements as reliable transfer of any other files from donors
	- Need to ensure sufficient storage available; email accounts covering several years with frequent use of attachments can easily take up multiple Terrabytes, and size may not be immediately apparant if not using a simple file download and transfer.
- Converting emails between formats
  - Various software solutions exist; there is no one size fits all
  - Choice often depends on required input / output formats. Some tools are designed to chain better into specific further steps
- Appraising email collections
  - https://ratom.web.unc.edu/
- Redacting information within emails
  - https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd
- Providing access to email collections
  - What data do you want to make available?
  - How will you mediate access?
  - Public portal vs dedicated terminal(s) at repository

### Internal policies required

**Collecting Policy**

You may wish to restrict to collecting certain formats which can be dealt with via simple workflows, or conversely be restricted to only being able to process certain formats eg by restrictions on what tools can be used from an IT department.
Similarly, you may wish to require that any encryped material has protections removed before transfer, or refuse such material outright.

**Access policy**

Copyright

It is almost inevitable that there will be 3rd party copyright in any email account. The consequences of this will vary by location, but generally speaking 3rd parties will have copyright over the content of any emails they sent, which may well be replicated in reply chains, or similar. The depositor will likely only have copyright over their sent emails, not including any 3rd party reply chain content.

Ethical concerns - 3rd party information

Many email collections may contain information on 3rd parties that is not covered by data protection legislation, but may still cause distress if it were published. You may wish to consider and flag such information in your appraisal process, and treat access differently.

Redaction & Embargo periods
> Is there anything email-specific about redaction & embargo policy? Certainly good to flag redaction tools, but that would belong in another section

> Should confirm that everything listed here really is policy level stuff, rather than per-collection considerations to be made at the end of the process, and hence discussed further down this document
  
### Assembling your team

There will be wide variance here depending on the size of your organisation, and what processess are in-scope. This section could be used by a lone archivist to identify which tasks they should be considering and can cover with their current skills; or by a large organisation to work out which departments need to be included. Some of these things may be able to be covered by external contractors, vendors, professional groups, etc.

Project needs can include:

*   Sourcing collections
*   Transfer to organization
*   Appraising/processing
*   file format conversion for preservation & access
*   facilitating storage environment, storage, processing, access tools
*   file format experts
*   copyright & legal concerns
*   Data security and privacy 
*   Processing the collection
*   Providing access to the collection
*   Overarching project management and leadership

Roles which may map to these needs include:

*   Curators/archivists
*   IT staff
*   Processing staff
*   Copyright officers 
*   Privacy officers / Data Protection Lead
*   Legal staff
*   Outreach
*   Project champion
*   Vendors (technical, storage, legal advice)


> Need to work out how to ensure this section doesn't just repeat / overlap with the Processes section above

## Working with Donors/Creators

This section has been split in to two parts; dealing with internal email for an organisation's own archives or similar sitations where the record creator is obliged to provide their email, and recieving email from external donors.
